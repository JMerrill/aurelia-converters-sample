      # Aurelia Value Converters
      An overview of the [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) framework's value
      converter functionality.

      This page is written using Aurelia and contains live examples.  The full
      source is [here](https://github.com/jdanyow/aurelia-converters-sample).

      *Note:  The following examples assume you have a basic understanding of
      Aurelia data-binding.  Check out the getting started video
      [here](http://aurelia.io/) or the docs [here](http://aurelia.io/docs.html)
      for more information.*

      ## Introduction

      A short description of data-binding from the Aurelia
      [docs](http://aurelia.io/docs.html):

      *In Aurelia, user interface elements are composed of view and view-model
      pairs. The view is written with HTML and is rendered into the DOM. The
      view-model is written with JavaScript and provides data and behavior to
      the view.  Aurelia's powerful databinding links the two pieces together
      allowing changes in your data to be reflected in the view and vice versa.*

      Here's a simple data-binding example using the bind (`.bind`) and
      interpolation (`$ {propertyName}`) techniques:

    <sample src="samples/1"></sample>

    <markdown>
      Sometimes the raw data exposed by your view-model isn't in a format that's
      ideal for displaying in the UI.  Displaying date and numeric values are
      common scenarios:

    <sample src="samples/2"></sample>

    <markdown>
      Ideally the date would be in a more readable format and the amount would
      be formatted as currency.  One solution to this problem would be to compute
      the formatted values and expose them as properties of the view-model.  This
      is certainly a valid approach however defining extra properties and methods
      in your models can get messy, especially when you need to keep the formatted
      values in sync when the original property values change.  Fortunately
      Aurelia has a feature that makes solving this problem quite easy...

      ## Value Converters

      **A value converter is a class whose responsibility is to convert view-model
      values into values that are appropriate to bind to a view *and visa-versa*.**

      Most commonly you'll be creating value converters that translate model data
      to a format suitable for the view however there are situations where you'll
      need to convert data from the view to a format expected by the view-model,
      typically when using two-way binding with input elements.

      If you've used value converters in other languages such as WPF/Silverlight
      you'll find Aurelia value converters are quite similar although with a few
      notable improvements:

      1. The Aurelia ValueConverter interface uses `toView` and `fromView` methods
        which make it quite clear which direction the data is flowing.  This is in
        contrast to WPF's `IValueConverter` which uses `Convert` and `ConvertBack`.
      2. In Aurelia, converter parameter's can be data-bound.  This is something
        that was missing in Silverlight and enables more advanced binding scenarios.
      3. Aurelia value converter methods can accept multiple parameters.

      4. Multiple value converters can be &quot;piped&quot; together.
        todo: explain why this is awesome.

      Before we get too far into the details, let's re-work the previous example
      to use a couple of basic value converters.  Aurelia and the popular
      [Moment](http://momentjs.com/) and [Numeral](http://numeraljs.com/) libraries
      will take care of the heavy lifting, we just need to wire things up...
