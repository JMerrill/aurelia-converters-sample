      # Aurelia Value Converters
      An overview of the [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) framework's value
      converter functionality.

      This page is written using Aurelia and contains live examples.  The full
      source is [here](https://github.com/jdanyow/aurelia-converters-sample).

      *Note:  The following examples assume you have a basic understanding of
      Aurelia data-binding.  Check out the getting started video
      [here](http://aurelia.io/) or the docs [here](http://aurelia.io/docs.html)
      for more information.*

      ## Introduction

      A short description of data-binding from the Aurelia
      [docs](http://aurelia.io/docs.html):

      *In Aurelia, user interface elements are composed of view and view-model
      pairs. The view is written with HTML and is rendered into the DOM. The
      view-model is written with JavaScript and provides data and behavior to
      the view.  Aurelia's powerful databinding links the two pieces together
      allowing changes in your data to be reflected in the view and vice versa.*

      Here's a simple data-binding example using the bind and interpolation
      techniques:
      ">
    </div>

    <sample src="samples/1"></sample>

    Sometimes the raw data exposed by your view-model isn't in a format that's
    ideal for displaying in the UI.  Displaying date and numeric values are
    common scenarios:

    <sample src="samples/2"></sample>

  </div>
